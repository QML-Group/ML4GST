1. 1 qubit long sequence gate set tomography simulated dataset, generated by pygsti using explicit model from expression method
2. Dataset has been postprocessed and converted to a csv file for neural network training
3. Simple fully-connected feed-forward network that takes encoded padded gate sequence as input and a single value rotational angle theta for gate X
4. apply_gate (apply_gate_sequence) can only take one gate (one gate sequence) at a time, cannot process batched data in parallel
5. for loops have been utilized to loop over apply_gate and apply_gate_sequence functions to process batched data instead
