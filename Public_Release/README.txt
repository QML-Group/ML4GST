Description for 3 notebooks:

1. transformer_gst_original_paper
	- original model that was used to produce data in the paper

2. transformer_gst_reduced_dense_layers
	- reduced unnecessary dense layers in the original model
	
3. transformer_gst_sigmoid_standardized
	- an extension to notebook "2. transformer_gst_reduced_dense_layers"
	- changed to standardized tensor shape: (batch_size, sequence length, feature dimension) as input for the transformer
	- changed to scaled sigmoid activation function for depolarizing errors, stablizing training
	
	
	
Dataset:

1. Custom_1Q_XYI_dataset_XY_custom_depol_over_rotate_X_0.01_0.1_Y_0.02_0.2_10k_shots_2^5_max_lengths
	- raw dataset generated by pygsti simulation

2. Sorted_Encoded_Padded_Probabilities
	- processed dataset, used in training
